## Pipelines

All of the pipelines are built using the `snakemake` workflow management system and held in the `analysis` directory. Each pipeline is meant to be run independently to generate intermediate results and comes with its own conda environment. Whenever possible we detail the intermdiate data generated. We briefly detail these pipelines below:

1. `analysis/crossovers`

2. `analysis/co_post_process`

3. `analysis/simulations/`

4. `analysis/gwas` : Conducts full sex-specific GWAS and heritability analysis for recombination-derived phenotypes
